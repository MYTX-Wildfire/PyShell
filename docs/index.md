# PyShell
## What is PyShell?
PyShell is a Python library designed to help developers create shell scripts.
At its most basic, PyShell can be thought of as a wrapper around
`subprocess.run()` that allows IDEs to display autocompletion help for commands.
However, PyShell is much more than a basic wrapper and offers many features that
greatly improve development workflows.
