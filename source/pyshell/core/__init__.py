## @package pyshell.core
# Contains PyShell core classes.

## @defgroup modules Modules
# Modules allow easier access to PyShell commands.
# Modules allow PyShell commands to be invoked via a single function call rather
#   than constructing a PyShell command instance and then executing it. For
#   PyShell scripts that don't need advanced PyShell features like parallel
#   execution, modules are the recommended way to invoke PyShell commands.
